# PascalCoin-Escrow
Escrow Service for PascalCoin

PascalCoin Escrow is an example to show how an Ecrow Service for PascalCoin can be developed using RPC-Json. 
Warning: The program needs a lot more error checking and debugging.

It uses the Payload so all PascalCoin account holders can communicate manually from the wallet to the Escrow Service.

Compile with Lazarus and Free Pascal for Windows or Linux
